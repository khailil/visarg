For my visual argument I'm creating a series of videogame posters for a game that me and my roommates are currently developing. 
The game has a heavy focus on global warming and so these posters will double as an advertisment for our game, but also a call
to action for climate issues.


*note about files, since I was not using Gimp, I opted to upload in progress screenshots of my working process since the raw file type was not supported by github.
